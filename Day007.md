## Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).

For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 
Therefore, the time now is 1:05am. 

So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.

b2 = int(input())
c2 = int(input())
print((3600*(a1-a2)+(60*(b1-b2))+(c1-c2)))
