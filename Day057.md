## Second Biggest Value
Write a function second_biggest_value which accepts three integers, and does the following:
returns the second biggest value among the three
returns “NA” if there are two or more equal values

Come up with a solution which does not use sorting!

```
Example

(1, 2, 3) -> 2
(3, 1, -1) -> 1
(3, 5, -1) -> 3
(3, -1, -1) -> "NA"
```

```
```
