## Sculpture Logic


In a particular museum, a section of the building containing N rooms has been allotted for placing all the important bronze sculptures. The movers who brought the sculptures randomly dropped them off into different rooms. 

The curator of the museum now wants each of the N rooms to have the same number of items. That way, crowd management of the visitors will be better. 

Any one of the rooms may have exactly one sculpture less or more than what is available in the other rooms.
It can be assumed that the total number of sculptures is equal to or more than the total number of rooms. 

Write a function that will accept one argument: 
  - a list containing the number of sculptures in each of the rooms 

The output of the function must be the count of number of moves (or transfers) that are required to equalize the sculptures in the rooms. 

That is, one sculpture transferred from one room to another counts as one move/transfer.

Sample Input / Output:
input     -> [3, 3, 2, 4]
output   -> 1

input    -> [6, 5, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5]
output  -> 5
```
