6)[Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight.

29)[The Missing Spy PlaneThe Indian Air Force (IAF)  is using more than 10,000 spy planes to  go across LoC to scout for terrorist camps in Pakistan. Whenever a spy   plane takes off for reconnaissance, the Plane ID is added to a list.  Whenever the plane returns, the ID is again added to the same list.   One spy plane alone has gone missing, so its ID was not added to the  list a second time.  By the way, IDs are not guaranteed to be  sorted or sequential.1. Given a list of plane IDs, write a program to print out the ID of the missing spy plane. 2. If no plane is found missing, then print "All arrived!"  Bonus 2. The IAF is very keen to have the most efficient algorithm / solution.   It wants one program that can finish within 10 milliseconds, even when   there are more than 10 lakh sorties across the LoC by the spy planes,  i.e. each spy plane might make upto 100+  visits across the LoC.](Day029.md)
