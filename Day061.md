## Friends of friends
We can create a dictionary mapping people to sets of their friends. For example, we might say:

d["fred"]  = set(["wilma", "betty", "barney", "bam-bam"])  
d["wilma"] = set(["fred", "betty", "dino"])

With this in mind, write a function friend_of_friends that takes such a dictionary mapping
of people to sets of friends and returns a new dictionary mapping all the same people to sets of their friends of friends.


```
For example, since wilma is a friend of fred, and dino is a friend of wilma, 

dino is a friend-of-friend of fred.

This set should exclude any direct friends, so even though betty is also a friend of wilma, betty does not count as a friend-of-friend of fred (since she is simply a friend of fred).

Thus, in this example, fred’s ‘friends-of-friends’ is a set containing just dino and 
wilma’s ‘friends-of-friends’ is a set containing both barney and bam-bam.

Also, do not include anyone either in their own set of friends or their own 
set of friends-of-friends. 

You may assume that everyone listed in any of the friend sets also is included 
as a key in the dictionary.

```
def friend_of_friends(fr):  
  ffr={}    
  for x,y in fr.items():
    m=[]
    m.append(x)  
    m=set(m)  
    ts=set() 
    for r in y:  
      s=fr[r]  
      ts=ts.union(s) 
        
   
    ts=ts.difference(y)      
  
  
    ts=ts.difference(m)
    ffr[x]=ts     
  
  
  return ffr   
a=friend_of_friends({ 'fred' : set(["wilma", "betty", "barney", "bambam"]), "wilma" : set(["fred", "betty", "dino"]), "betty" : set(["fred", "wilma"]), "barney" : set(["fred", "dino"]), 'bambam' : set(["fred"]),
'dino' : set(["wilma", "fred"]) })
print(a)

  
```
